build a game where I crash land in a field
No memory of who I am
I am a robot
my initial goal is given in the top right
I can see my stats in the top left, including health
Instead of a seperate screen for battles, I want to be able to punch and shoot projectiles


I'm in my own source code
I start as a boy
There's a bug in the code
There's a bunch of different bosses which are different structures
factory, observer, singleton/multiton

As I beat boss after boss I get new abilities and I become more and more of a robot
- hit that existential crisis

end is where I wake up as a boy robot who fell down the stairs and has been recovering in a hospital of sorts. Last part of the level is for me to escape the house and be free

I fight the robotic desires to be stronger and decide to become just a boy in the end


name: bug in the system
start level: everything is white and as I move through the levels and add to my robot features, pieces begin to come back
Attacks: can shoot a force across the map until it hits a wall or an enemy, enemies can be super simple and walk aimlessly
	 can't initially attack, learn how to punch with an upgrade. Opponents need to be able to attack too
Controls can be scrambled sometimes due to a "source code failure" triggered by some enemy attacks

turn based system or free roam?
